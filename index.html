Brief Description of Goal of Code:
The goal of this code is to create a symptom survey that will verfiy if somenone is Anemic of not. It includes 5 questions simple math equation to find 
the percentage of the probability of being anemic of not.
 
Known Issues:
The main issue I had was trying to figure out how to get the image to translate from the code.
